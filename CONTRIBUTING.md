# Contributing

NUKE is a free open-source project, with the goal that as many individuals as possible gain a benefit. We expect everyone to follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and it is important to understand [our philosophy](https://nuke.build/docs/getting-started/philosophy.html).

We appreciate any kind of contribution that helps to grow the project. Following next, we would like to outline a few possibilities, expectations and thoughts.

- [Become a stargazer](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/stargazers), especially when requesting features
- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nukebuildnet), join our [Slack workspace](https://slofile.com/slack/nukebuildnet) or [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/nuke-build/nuke)
- [Tweets](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=NUKE%20is%20awesome!%20https%3A%2F%2Fnuke.build), blog posts and other [testimonials](https://dotnet.libhunt.com/project/nuke/recommend) are very motivating
- Well-formed feedback is what shapes the technical future of the project
- [Issues are triaged](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22bug+%3Abeetle%3A%22+) carefully; make sure to include all important information, like _expected_ vs. _actual_ behavior, version numbers etc.
- Issues related to [unsupported tools](https://nuke.build/docs/authoring-builds/cli-tools.html#unsupported-tools) or [missing arguments](https://nuke.build/docs/authoring-builds/cli-tools.html#note-1) are not accepted; given the declarative code-generation approach, we expect pull-requests instead
- Pull-requests are much appreciated, but for trivial changes it's recommended to get in touch with the maintainers first
- Pull-requests must be started off from `develop` and should only use `git rebase`, i.e. not `git merge`
- If this project increases your productivity/income, consider becoming a [backer](https://opencollective.com/nuke/order/7399) (individuals) or [sponsor](https://opencollective.com/nuke/order/7400) (companies)
